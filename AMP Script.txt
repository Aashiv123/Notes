Personalization String-Syntax
-It is a dataExtension field values in an Email
%%First Name%%	-->field from dataExtension
%%LAST Name%%	-->attribute strings

Or it can Be Syntaxed as -
%%==%%
or
%%[]%%
or 
<script runat="server" language="ampscript">
	//ampScript
</script>

*************
Function-AMPscript function are pure functions, which means they take some input and return an output based on the input.
-You can move your function around your code making it easy to adapt

AMPscript functions work in much the same way as they do in microsoft excel,that is parameters are set for a predefined function,which are interpreted and in turn return a value

eg- SUM(1,2)
%%==SUM(1,2)%%

AMP Functions- %%==function==%%
Char,Concat,IndexOf,IIF,Empty,Length,Lowercase,UpperCase,Mod,Now,ProperCase,Random,replace,Add,Trim

***********
AMPscript Variables-just like other language amp script has variables
And this variables are Defined as @name

How are this variables Declared= var @firstName, @lastName

-if we declare this variables the value will be null
-Now we will be setting some  value to this variables

%%[var @firstName
set @firstName= FirstName
set @localDate = SystemDateToLocalDate(Now())
set @promotionEndDate = '10/15/2018'
]%%


****************
Now we will changing var values-
eg-the value of promotionEndDate is taken from some Data Extension
%%[
	var @promotionEndDate, @memberStatus
	set @promotionEndDate= '10/15/2018'
	set @memberStatus= status

	if @memberStatus== 'gold' then
		set @promotionEndDate= '11/15/2018'

	end if
]%%

************
Passing variables in a function-
if the variable has previously been declared, then it can be used as an argument to a function, based on its previous value
eg-
%%[
	var @promotionEndDate, @memberStatus
	set @promotionEndDate='10/15/2018'
	set @memberStatus= status

	if @memberStatus=='gold' then
		set @promotionEndDate= DateAdd(@promotionaEndDate, 1, 'M')
endif
]%%

********************
Setting the value to null-
once a variable has been set, it can be reset by declaring the value again. 
eg-
%%[
	var @membershipEndDate, @emberStatus
	set @membershipEnddate='10/15/2018'
	set @memberStatus= status

	if @membershipEndDate > Now() then
	var @memberStatus
	endif
]%%

**********************
Like other scripting languages, AMPscript is interpreted from top to bottom, which means that variables have to be declared and set before they can be used. However, email components are interpreted in the following order:

Preheader
HTML body
Text body
Subject line

<!--Appears in Body-->
%%[
	var @subjectLine
	if AttributeValue('Member Status') == 'VIP' then
  set @subjectLine = 'An exclusive offer for VIP members'
else
  set @subjectLine = 'A special offer for our members'
endif
]%%

<!--Appears in Subject Line-->
%%=v(@subjectLine)=%%

****************
<p>Hello %%=v(@displayName)=%%,</p>
v=Outputs the value of the variable
