For subscriber we have to map email and Subscriber key

Subscriber Status-active,unsubscribed,held/undeliverable(grey),bounced(yellow)

profile Attributes-Input relevant information about the subscriber(firstName,lastName,contactNumber)

Preference Attributes(boolean value)-Know what kind of communication the subscriber prefer,we can save the customer preference (like html formate)

if at parent level we have defined Profile attributes and preference attributes,then child level also has to follow this.that means we cannot change the profile attributes and preference attributes at child level

isTestable-do you want to test that email before sending the mail

DataRetention policy-We can delete the record based on the 3 catogery
individual,all records,all reecords and data extion
Period-after which time the records will be deleted

Only if isEditible-then
make one key always Primary key,or we can also combine 2 field to make one Primary Key

send Relationship Cust_id related to Subscribe on Subscriber key
-it means cust_id will be Subsbcriber key

We can also import the list-
list-import-->next-->map

***************
Publication List(NewLetter,Offers,ReceiveVouchers)-Publication lists make it possible for subscribers to opt out of a category of sends without opting out of all messages from your organization.

A publication list helps you manage how subscribers receive several different categories of emails or SMS messages. For example, send newsletters, advertisements, and alerts. Each of these is a different category, so create a separate publication list for each category. When you send a newsletter, associate the send with the newsletter publication list to identify to the system what kind of content is inside the publication.

*********************
SUpression list-Add those subscriber who you dont want to send the email.
eg-those who are competitor

****************
Marketing automation-
Journey Builder-will create the complete journey of customer,by using Autoation process that u have creaded in Automation Stdio

Automation Studio-
Starting Sources
Activities
Flow

Starting Sources-Starting point
Schedule-Start Imidiately or at perticular Time
File Drop-This is related to FTP (File transfer prototype)

Whenever the file is updated from External System always create a compresed zip file.
-This file is unziped / decrypts files and place it in SFMC in
SFMC Safehouse(.csv),(It is a black box)
-File Data updated in DE(Salesforce Marketing cloud)

FILE TRANSFER-INBOUND

External System-->FTP (ZIP)-->SFMC Safehouse-->File data updated in DE
**********
Similarly We can do File transfer Activity-Outbound-
Only reversal of direction

Data Extension-->SFMC safehouse-->FTP (.zip)-->external ystem/process

Activities-What activity to perform

**************
Data Filter Activity-
Source Data Extension-->data Filter-->Data Extension/list

When we want to extract data from (Data Extension) Source but with some filtered data then it overwrites the data and will make the list

If we have multiple Source Data Extension and we want to get the data from this data extension,then we will be using SQL query,it will also overwrite the data
